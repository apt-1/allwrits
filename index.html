<h4>History</h4>
  <span style="text-indent:1em;">
    <p>Section 1651 extends the power to issue writs in aid of jurisdiction, to all courts established by Act of Congress, thus making explicit the right to exercise powers implied from the creation of such courts. This section consolidated 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;342, 376, 377 (1940), which derived from the Judiciary Act of 1911, secs. 234, 261, 262, 36 Stat. 1156, 1162 (Mar. 3, 1911). Those former sections read as follows and were modified as explained in parentheses:</P>

        <p>&sect;&nbsp;342. &#8220;The Supreme Court shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed under the authority of the United States, or to persons holding office under the authority of the United States, where a State, or an ambassador, or other public minister, or a consul, or vice consul is a party.&#8221; (The special provisions of former &sect;&nbsp;342 with reference to writs of prohibition and mandamus, admiralty courts, and other courts and officers of the United States were omitted from this section as unnecessary.)</p>

        <p>&sect;&nbsp;376. &#8220;Writs of <em>ne exeat</em> may be granted by any justice of the Supreme Court, in cases where they might be granted by the Supreme Court; and by any district judge, in cases where they might be granted by the district court of which he is a judge. But no writ of <em>ne exeat</em> shall be granted unless a suit in equity is commenced, and satisfactory proof is made to the court or judge granting the same that the defendant designs quickly to depart from the United States.&#8221; (The provisions of &sect;&nbsp;376 with respect to the powers of a justice or judge in issuing writs of <em>ne exeat</em> were changed and made the basis of subsection (b) but the conditions and limitations on the writ of <em>ne exeat</em> were omitted as merely confirmatory of well-settled principles of law.)</p>

        <p>&sect;&nbsp;377. &#8220;The Supreme Court and the district courts shall have power to issue writs of <em>scire facias</em>. The Supreme Court, the circuit courts of appeals, and the district courts shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.&#8221; (The provision in &sect;&nbsp;377 authorizing issuance of writs of <em>scire facias</em>, was omitted in view of the abolition of that writ by Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(b). Section 1651 is expressive of the construction recently placed upon such section by the Supreme Court in <em>United States Alkali Export Ass&#8217;n v. United States</em>, 325 U.S. 196 (1945), and <em>De Beers Consolidated Mines v. United States</em>, 325 U.S. 212 (1945).)</p>
